## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Pull Request/Merge Request MCP Tools**: New built-in tools for PR/MR management:
  - `get_pull_request`: Fetch PR/MR details including comments and diff
  - `update_pull_request`: Update PR/MR state, submit reviews (approve, request changes, comment)
  - `add_comment`: Add comments to PRs/MRs (general, inline code comments, threaded replies)
  - `update_comment`: Update or resolve existing PR/MR comments
  - Works with both GitHub Pull Requests and GitLab Merge Requests
- **Android Push Notifications (FCM)**: Native Firebase Cloud Messaging support for Android mobile app push notifications
- **Push Proxy**: Proxy endpoint allowing OSS instances to send push notifications via production infrastructure
- **Message-based WebSocket Authentication**: Secure WebSocket auth via message after connection (tokens no longer in URLs)
- **Periodic Version Checker**: Automatic daily version check against preloop.ai (configurable interval, opt-out available)
- **Admin Activity Monitor**: Click-to-navigate from session to user/account details

### Changed

- **FCM Service**: Moved Firebase SDK calls to thread pool executor to avoid blocking the event loop
- **Session Manager**: Database writes now run in thread pool to prevent event loop blocking during connection spikes
- **WebSocket Endpoints**: Updated to support message-based authentication for browsers

### Deprecated

- **`get_merge_request` MCP Tool**: Use `get_pull_request` instead. Works with both GitHub PRs and GitLab MRs.
- **`update_merge_request` MCP Tool**: Use `update_pull_request` instead. Works with both GitHub PRs and GitLab MRs.

### Fixed

- **GitHub Inline Comment ID**: `add_comment` now returns the actual comment ID instead of the review ID for GitHub inline comments, enabling proper follow-up updates via `update_comment`
- **Thread Resolution Validation**: `update_comment` now properly validates that `thread_id` is required for resolving threads. GitHub requires a thread ID (format: `PRRT_...`), not a comment ID.
- **Inline Comment Side Parameter**: `add_comment` no longer validates the `side` parameter for non-inline comments, fixing errors when `side` was passed for regular comments
- **Event Loop Blocking**: FCM notifications and session DB writes no longer block the FastAPI event loop
- **WebSocket Middleware Paths**: Middleware now handles `/api/v1/ws` prefixed paths correctly
- **Telemetry Env Var**: Both `PRELOOP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY` and `DISABLE_VERSION_CHECK` now work to disable telemetry
- **Session Manager Thread Safety**: DB writes now use thread-local sessions to avoid SQLAlchemy thread-safety issues
- **WebSocket Auth Upgrade**: Anonymous users upgrading to authenticated are now properly registered for broadcast messages
- **OpenAI API Errors**: Issue duplicates endpoint now returns 503 for API auth/rate limit errors instead of 500

### Configuration

New environment variables (see `.env.example`):
- `FCM_CREDENTIALS_JSON` / `FCM_CREDENTIALS_PATH`: Firebase service account credentials
- `PUSH_PROXY_URL` / `PUSH_PROXY_API_KEY`: Push proxy configuration for OSS instances
- `PRELOOP_DISABLE_TELEMETRY`: Disable version check telemetry
- `VERSION_CHECK_INTERVAL`: Seconds between version checks (default: 86400 = 24h)
